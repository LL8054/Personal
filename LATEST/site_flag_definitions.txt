% This file is a plain text export of a portion of the temperature data contained 
% in Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Analysis.
% 
% The associated dataset name is shown above, while this file should have the 
% name
% 
% 	site_flag_definitions.txt
% 
% For general information about this data product, please refer to the data set 
% readme file: README.txt
% 
% The current file contains descriptions of the per site quality control and 
% metadata flags.  The main temperature data, other secondary data, and related 
% station metadata can be found in other files in the same directory and should 
% be distributed together.
% 
% The columns contained in this file are as follows:
% 
% Flag ID: A unique integer identifying each source archive.
% 
% 	Flag Description: A text description of the meaning of the flag.
% 
% The site information may be found in files of the form
% 
% 	site_detail.txt
% 	site_complete_detail.txt
% 
% Only site flags actually in use in this dataset will appear below.  Site flag 
% values should remain stable over time and retain the same meaning for all 
% Berkeley temperature datasets.  If no content appears below, it is because no 
% data flags are used in this dataset.
